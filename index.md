## Values

  - I value **learning** and striving for **improvement** in whatever I am committing myself to.
  - I value **compassion** and making the world a more pleasant place to exist in.
  - I enjoy being apart of a **team** but sometimes need time to zone out and focus.
  
## Personality

  - I make sure I'm giving my best but I don't let that interfere with being nice. I think it's important to have fun even when facing challenges or stress.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?
  - Positive: In private, a slack message is fine
  - Negative: It can be as direct as it needs to be, as long as I'm given direction on how to improve it.

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?
  - I tend to be at my desk around 9:00 am ET, after walking the dog, exercising, and taking my daughter to daycare
  - I work until 5:30ish, if I still have work that needs to be done I take a short break for night time chores and resume around 6:00ish.

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? How do your energy levels fluctuate through-
out the day?
  - The morning hours between 10:00 and 12:00 tend to be my most productive. After I have had coffee and clear any To Do items that may have arisen overnight.
  - I like meetings to be in the afternoon because by that time my brain is usually feeling a bit fatigued and I benefit from switching gears. Or ideally, grouped together on a single "Meeting Day".

## Communication Preferences

What should people expect from you when they reach out to you on Yammer, Email, or Slack?
How should people best get your attention for urgent matters, during and out of your working hours? What's your relationship to work communication when not at work? What are your signs that you'd prefer to not be interrupted when at work?

  - Slack is normally the most convenient way to communicate but for urgent matters, texting is the best way to get my attention
  - I'll set myself as away on Slack and hide notifications when necessary
  - I find frequent short breaks throughout the day are key to keeping my feeling fresh. I might step outside or give some attention to my very needy dog (Conan).

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?
What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?

  - Honestly, I'm pretty even keeled. I rarely get very excited or overly stressed. In big groups, I tend to let other people do the talking unless I am called out. I can also be reserved until I get comfortable within a group, which can take some time. But once I am comfortable I look forward to team interactions.


## Me Being Me

Any habits that of yours that can be easily misinterpreted? Here's a good place to point them out.

  - Sometimes to break tension or when things feel uncomfortable I'll make jokes. I am not intending to make light of the situation.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._
  
  - I really dislike when I don't feel heard or when I am interrupted, but then again, who doesn't?

## Career Goals & Future Interests

What long term career goals do you have for yourself? What interests do you hope or plan for your
future self to obsess over.
  - I am taking things one step at a time right now, I just want to learn and improve as an engineer.

## Areas for Development

Anything you'd like us to know about yourself that makes you (gasp!) not perfect? If they are as-
pects you'd like to change or are working on, this might be a good place to point out constructive
and positive ways we can help you be aware of and take corrective action in the moment.

  - I need to get better about asking for help and not spinning my wheels when I get stuck.

## Ask Me About

Let's get to know one another! Here's a great place to list things you've done / activities you love
/ conversations you're (almost) always excited to have!

  - The Grateful Dead
  - Dogs
  - Running
  - Reading
